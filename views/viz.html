      <td><P align=justify>A joint project between the BAN and the MIT Senseable City Lab has led to the discovery of previously unknown international electronic waste smuggling routes. Seven CRT monitors embedded with tracking devices were deposited at electronics recyclers in Los Angeles, California. These trackers revealed that five monitors were exported to Asia via ports in Vietnam, China, and Malaysia.

        CRTs are categorized as toxic waste due to the high content of lead in their glass, and they are the only e-waste export that the federal government restricts. Previous investigative reports by BAN and other groups have documented the export of e-waste to Asian and African ports, and pinpointed regions of Nigeria and China that had become toxic wastelands. However, many of the shipping routes and processing locations of CRTs and other e-waste remained a mystery.

        Our researchers tested and deployed several GPS trackers capable of remotely reporting their location from overseas locations. We also programmed cheaper smartphones to act as location trackers, forcing sleep cycles and soldering on external batteries to extend their life to up to four months. These hacked phones gave us additional data points and could photograph the environment through holes drilled in the monitor casing. We developed methods to embed the trackers and their batteries inside CRT monitors to avoid detection while retaining signal reach.

        The captured data indicate that five of the seven monitors were exported to Asia between August and November 2011. Entering through ports in Vietnam, China, and Malaysia, four devices ultimately settled in China, with the last ending up in Malaysia. This led to the discovery and documentation of a previously unknown smuggling route to e-waste recycling facilities in southern China, via the border region of northern Vietnam. There, e-waste is broken down into component parts, some of which can be salvaged intact and reassembled into consumer products for resale.

        On-the-ground investigations by BAN produced a clearer picture of these trade routes. E-waste enters the country in inter-modal containers through the port of Haiphong. Locals transfer the containers to semi trucks, which transport them 260km to the border town of Mong Cai on the Ka Long River. Interviews with locals and eyewitness reports revealed that small riverboats smuggle an array of goods, from e-waste and narcotics to endangered species and trafficked women, from Mong Cai to the Chinese border town of Dongxing.

        While legitimate e-waste recycling helps reduce landfill contamination and raw material extraction, illegal handling of electronic waste raises the risk of water and soil pollution, human illness, and subsequent social costs to public health and agriculture. Our experiment demonstrates how relatively cheap technology can generate unique data needed by NGOs and Interpol to track such "hidden flows". Since the time of our experiment, the UN Organization on Drugs and Crime has confirmed that the Mong Cai border is a primary corridor for e-waste flowing from the US and EU into China, part of an estimated US$3.75 billion market for illegal e-waste.
